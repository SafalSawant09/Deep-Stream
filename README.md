🌊 Focus Flow: Deep Work & Ambient Soundscapes
Focus Flow is a minimalist productivity companion designed to help you reclaim your concentration. By combining the scientifically-backed Pomodoro Technique with immersive, high-fidelity ambient audio, Focus Flow transforms "work time" into "flow state."

🚀 Core Features
The Glass Timer: A sleek, translucent countdown interface designed to minimize distractions while keeping you on track. Supports 25-minute sprints and 50-minute deep-work sessions.

Dynamic Sound Mixer: Curate your perfect acoustic environment. Layer 13 unique soundscapes, including:

Natural Elements: Rainfall, Forest, Ocean, Thunder.

Urban Comfort: Busy Cafe, Quiet Library, Train Ride.

Focus Frequencies: Brown, White, and Pink Noise, plus Alpha-Wave Binaural Beats.

Intentionality Tracking: Set a "Session Intention" before starting. Stating your goal out loud (or in the app) increases task-adherence by up to 40%.

Daily Streaks: Build a habit that lasts. Track your consecutive focus days and earn escalating rewards as your streak grows.
